<p>is an opiniated autodidact software developer, architect and software leader
with a strong ambition to do things right. With a thorough commitment to quality
and a selectively pragmatic approach he aims for long term sustainability in
software projects. He posseses an entrepeneurial spirit and gets excited as soon
as the economics of software development come into play: what choices can be
made when constraints arise? He is a very strong analytical thinker able to
transcend the problem domain of the mere software.</p>

<h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>

<h2 id="tech-lead-at-cleverbase">Tech lead at Cleverbase</h2>

<p><em>May 2017 - April 2019</em></p>

<p>As a tech lead at Cleverbase I lead the software development efforts in a high
demand security environment. Cleverbase is a Qualified Trust Service Provider.
Dealing with the certification and audit burden was an effort influencing the
entire organisation, especially the development team.</p>

<p>I was influential in important ops/infrastructure projects, coached junior and
medior developers, was responsible for code quality standards &amp; processes,
responsible for extending the team (recruitment) and had formal performance
reviews with the members of the development team. I was a member of the
management team (representative for technology.) Involved in strategic
(technical) decision making. Software architecure was an important part of my
work.</p>

<p>We worked with Akka, Scala, Mongo, Postgres, Ansible, AWS.</p>

<h2 id="cto-at-pallas-athena-group">CTO at Pallas Athena Group</h2>

<p><em>Feb 2015 - July 2016</em></p>

<p>As CTO of the Pallas Athena Group I was responsible for all technical
decissions. I was the architect of, and did build / implement large parts of a
Multi-Level Marketing eCommerce system that is very extensible. It does not
restrict the business developers of the company to a confined structure but
provides them with the means to create ad hoc flexible payment structures. I
managed the front-end development efforts of colleagues in this function while I
also gave guidance to other backend-developers.</p>

<p>We used primarily JVM based techniques (Java, lots of Scala) as well as a Graph
Database, Akka and RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing. The software consisted
of a variety of REST-ful APIs and was entirely stateless. We were keen on test
driven development.</p>

<p>The software that was written under my technical leadership will help Athena to
continue its growth and is a strong foundation for a bright future.</p>

<h2 id="freelance-independent-software-engineer">Freelance independent software engineer</h2>

<p><em>April 2013 - April 2017</em></p>

<p>Whilst being a freelance software developer I solved many complex problems.
Oftentimes for (design)agencies that did not need specific knowledge often
enought to hire an expert as an employee, but that could use my technical
ability and advice once in a while to insure their projects success.</p>

<p>A selection of some of the projects I worked on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the Dutch leading platform of reviews for service providers Opiness, I did
set up a large and quite customized ElasticSearch search engine. In this same
project I helped improve the accuracy of their weighted average review scores
by replacing a bunch of ineffecient PHP code with a very fast SQL procedure
that implemented all the rules (one of which was i.e. that a review that was
written more recently should have a greater weight-factor) and could
recalculate all the averages of +2M reviews in well under 120 seconds. When we
evaluated the project, the agency director Taeke Reijenga (see also
References) made the remark &ldquo;Without your support we would not have been able
to deliver this project on time nor with the desired (level of) functionality&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>In cooperation with Supersteil (nowadays TamTam) I developed a new Backend for
the KPN iPhone application Pointers. This was a painful measure, but a very
necessary one: the app grew more popular than the initial backend could handle
and a quick solution was needed. We corrected some of the most urgent problems
in the old backend, giving us some leverage in the form of time, and quickly
began making plans for a new one. We achieved speed improvements of (average)
+25000%. Used technologies were: Redis, Elasticsearch, NodeJS with Express. Our
iOS developer came from an international background, so this project had English
as main language of communication.</p></li>
