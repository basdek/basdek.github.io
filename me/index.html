<h1 id="mastering-hows">Mastering hows</h1>

<p>I am all about mastering hows. I offer two services: conception and
transformation. Depending on the phase of your idea or company one of these
takes precedence. However, I often do and can do both. What does that mean? And
why would you want to work with me?</p>

<p>I have a background and experience as a software engineer, devops engineer,
software architect and in leading teams of software engineers. I have the strong
conviction that these experiences increase eachothers power. I was born with an
entrepeneurial mindset and have employed that at every opportunity: At some
point I discovered that whatever task I am given, or under whichever pretence I
am hired, I will find where your organisation is hurting and will try to throw
myself at that particular problem. Because I am aware, or will grow to be aware,
that this pain point is hindering the tasks that you want completed in the first
place.</p>

<p>If you feel that you have an idea that you want to become manifest, but are
struggling to get your organisation in the shape to make it reality, you
probably need my help. Pragmatic where I can and principled where I must I can
guide your organisation towards the technical realisation of your idea. It is
often said that execution is everything. After a why, after a what, comes the
difficult <strong>how</strong> question. I care deeply for the hows of the world. That does
of course not mean I can&rsquo;t help you getting your whats &amp; whys sharper, more
realistic, or viable.</p>

<p>Highly motivated by doing things right and by a strong dislike for wasting
energy, both my own and that of good talented people, I am passionate to find
ways of doing things better. The average engineer turnover in our industry is
something to be collectively ashamed of and I strive to build cultures that do
better. The cost of software should not be expressed merely in terms of
development costs: the cost of maintaining and operating software in perpetuity
exceeds the cost of development many times over. That mindset is important and
you want it present in your culture if you are playing a long term game.
Developing anything is an expensive business to be in. You need someone with a
strong sense of both business and engineering to steer the ship over the
turbulent execution sea. That is the place where I get excited.</p>

<p>I attack problems with the analytical view of a software architect, but do not
limit my scope to your mere software alone. I want to join you as an
entrepeneurial partner, help you shape a fruitful future.</p>

<h3 id="tech-lead-at-cleverbase">Tech lead at Cleverbase</h3>

<p><em>May 2017 - April 2018</em></p>

<p>Originally hired as a software engineer I encountered a large gap in the devops
departement. I began by creating a CI/CD pipeline and dockerizing deployments.
Together with a colleague we did set up an AWS and colocated hardware hybrid
that met the high standards of Qualified Trust Service Provider certification.</p>

<p>Met with growing pains and too much deployment impredicatability that slipped
through the cracks over time I reverse engineered the network structure and
implemented a maintainable and highly useful map, outline of the network that
saved a lot of time (during maintenance and extension), brought calmness in the
infra departement again and allowed me to concentrate on other areas of
improvement in the company.</p>

<p>I coached developers, was responsible for setting the architectural course and
upheld and set coding standards and processes (ISO / ETSI). I represented the
engineering / development and test divisions in the management team, held one on
one meetings with my team and was responsible for the technical hiring. I
developed an assignment to effectively evaluate the skills of candidates.</p>

<h3 id="cto-at-pallas-athena-group">CTO at Pallas Athena Group</h3>

<p><em>February 2015 - July 2016</em></p>

<p>As the CTO of the Pallas Athena Group (mostly known for AthenaStudies) upon
joining the company I came to the conclusion that the existing tech was not
viable: hard to maintain, riddled with undefined and undeterministic behaviour.
I led a rewrite of the existing functionality based upon a more flexible
structure than what had existed before. Together with my business partner I
brought the company from a bedroom to an office, with 10 employees.</p>

<p>For PAG I developed software, set architectural course, was leading a team with
a frontenders and backenders and configured the CI/CD pipeline. The current team
at Pallas Athena Group continued their work upon solid structures I built and /
or started.</p>

<h3 id="projects-as-a-contractor">Projects as a contractor</h3>

<p><em>April 2013 - March 2015, September 2016 - April 2017</em></p>

<p>This is a limited overview with only the most relevant projects mentioned.</p>

<h4 id="1-opiness">1. Opiness</h4>

<p>For Opiness I was asked to implemented an elastic search based search system.
We created a system that implemented fuzzy searching, had location and distance
ranges and was able to handle mucht larger volumes than the original solution it
replaced.</p>

<p>Along the way I saw a chance to improve a particulary slow procedure for
calculating review averages on large amounts of data. I reimplemented the
weighted averaging formula in SQL, removing the extracting need and improving
the speed from 24 hours to completion, to a mere 2 minutes. A key example of
what I bring to the table: going an extra mile and looking creatively for ways
to improve.</p>

<h4 id="2-insights-abn-amro">2. Insights ABN AMRO</h4>

<p>For ABN AMRO I made a small system that aggregated the content of different
blogs into a shared search system. Amongst these blogs a global search frontend
allowed seemless switching between content from one site to another.</p>

<h4 id="3-pointers-powered-by-kpn">3. Pointers (powered by KPN)</h4>

<p>Pointers was one of the most interesting and fun projects I have had the
opportunity to work on.</p>

<p>It began when I was asked to consult on heavy scaling issues as the backend of
the project could not handle the pressure of its success after becoming app of
the day in the Apple store. It quickly became apparent that the backend was
architected in a ways that were fundamentally flawed. After reaching this
conclusion we reimplemented the backend with a team of the original designers
(that knew al about what they wanted and provide ample guidance on what and
why), a backend developer and an iOS developer. I was primairly involved in
(storage) architecture, reimplementation / rethinking of the recomendation
algorithms and helped develop the new software.</p>

<p>This project was a very clear example that you are not done when it seems to
work and to know that and guide what follows is an important expertise.</p>
