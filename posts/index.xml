      <description>Hello, I am Bas I worked in software professionally (i.e. getting paid to write software of some sorts) for over six years. I have been interested in software for as long as I can remember. My father sparked this interest back when I was 11 years old, when he showed me the possibilities of Microsoft Excel&amp;hellip; One could say that he gave me a natural predisposition towards reactive programming :)</description>
