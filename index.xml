      <description>Hello, I am Bas I worked in software professionally (i.e. getting paid to write software of some sorts) for over six years. I have been interested in software for as long as I can remember. My father sparked this interest back when I was 11 years old, when he showed me the possibilities of Microsoft Excel&amp;hellip; One could say that he gave me a natural predisposition towards reactive programming :)</description>

      <description>Bas de Kwant is an opiniated autodidact software developer, architect and software leader with a strong ambition to do things right. With a thorough commitment to quality and a selectively pragmatic approach he aims for long term sustainability in software projects. He posseses an entrepeneurial spirit and gets excited as soon as the economics of software development come into play: what choices can be made when constraints arise? He is a very strong analytical thinker able to transcend the problem domain of the mere software.</description>
